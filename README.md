R - Statistical Computing
===
This Splunk app provides a new Splunk search language
command 'r' that allows passing data from Splunk to the R-Engine
for calculation and then passing results back to Splunk for
further computation or visualization.

R is a language and environment for statistical computing. It
provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...) techniques, and is highly extensible.

Here's a link the actual [R-Project](http://www.r-project.org/) website.

Status
---
This project is in a very early alpha status and should not be used in a
production environment.

I Need your Help
---
I'm not a R expert, that's why I need your help
to show more and better examples (see below).

Please send me your feedback, questions and suggestions
at [rfujara@splunk.com](rfujara@splunk.com).
