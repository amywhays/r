R - Statistical Computing
===
This Splunk app provides a new Splunk search language
command 'r' that allows passing data from Splunk to the R-Engine
for calculation and then passing results back to Splunk for
further computation or visualization.

R is a language and environment for statistical computing. It
provides a wide variety of statistical (linear and nonlinear
modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis,
classification, clustering, ...) techniques, and is highly extensible.

Here's a link the actual [R-Project](http://www.r-project.org/) website.
